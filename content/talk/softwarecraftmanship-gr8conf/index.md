# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Software Craftsmanship is a movement in software engineering that aims to regard software development as a skilled craft instead of a classical engineering approach. The movement relies on 4 principles: Clean Code, practice, lifelong learning and communities. In our talk – which includes many examples and pictures – we would like to talk about its origin and the historic background, its current state and all available forms of participation. Hence, we want to encourage you to build (upon) a strong community spirit so that you may tread the path of becoming a software crafter yourself"
